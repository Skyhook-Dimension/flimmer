A Flimmer project created in flutter using OMDB Api and Provider. Flimmer supports both web and mobile, clone the appropriate branches mentioned below:

* For Frontend: https://github.com/Skyhook-Dimension/flimmer
* For Backend: https://github.com/Skyhook-Dimension/flimmer-backend


## Getting Started

The Flimmer contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.
